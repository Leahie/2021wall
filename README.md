## Contribute
To contribute, first fork this repository and clone it to your computer. In your favorite text editor, create a new HTML file at the root of this repository. Copy the boilerplate from `boilerplate.html` and add anything you'd like, so long as it's school appropriate! Make sure to mention that you wrote that page somewhere, though.

After you're done writing content and structuring it using HTML, add your name to the list on `about.html` by following the formatting from previous students. Then, make a pull request to our group repository!
